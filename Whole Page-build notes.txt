Staggered fade in entrance animations for elements as user scrolls down the page

Hero
Golden radial gradient subtle fade in from background
Large headline text should have a nice vertical reveal up
Logo and top right nav can slide in from top on load
Video to autoplay in background with no sound (video should not be masked by header content)

Menu
Menu icon bars to smoothly animate to ‘X’ close icon. 
Main menu to quickly appear in (not instant, but smooth and quick), no crazy slide or fly in’s from off canvas.
Main menu items to animate in, each one in staggered motion down, so top one appears first, then each one below. 
Menu should not be full browser height, but have a 80% black opaque overlay so user can see main website content below it. When user clicks off the mega menu in the overlay area, mega menu should close. 

Intro Text
Need some nice word by word or sentence by sentence quick load in animation to reveal. 

Stats Block
Vertical Lines should animate down and stat numbers should have counter animation up to their current numbers.
